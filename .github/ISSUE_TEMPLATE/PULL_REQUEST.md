> [Pull Requests](https://github.com/DarkByte7/AssemblyReporter/pulls) â–¸ **Create a new Pull Request - Application Form**

>  ***Disclaimer***: Please fill out the application form as best as you can, since that will help the developers to begin the review process of the proposed new changes or improvements and finish testing sooner. Which may vary in time depending on the size of the `Pull Request`.

<br>  **IMPORTANT**: :exclamation: Indicates any marked field that is required.<br><br>

:exclamation: **Describe the changes you have made to improve this project**:<br>
A clear and concise description of what the changes are.

<br>  **Unit testing**:<br>
If it's possible then make a unit test or multiple if necessary depending on the size of your `Pull Request`. To also demonstrate a sample of your new improvements in action getting unit tested and passing. That would let others peer review it faster with more ease and save time on settings up test environments with various conditions. Which would lead to  resolve any issues more efficiently making it eventually a nearly automated process. That by the end of it will be even more polished maybe but most importantly ready to be used by others.
