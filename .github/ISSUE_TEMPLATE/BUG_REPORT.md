<br>  **IMPORTANT**: :exclamation: Indicates any marked field that is required.<br><br>

:exclamation: **Describe the Issue**:<br>
A clear and concise description of the `Issue`.


<br> :exclamation: **Environment**:

- AssemblyReporter version [e.g. v0.4.0.1]
- Operating System (OS): [e.g. Win10 1803]
- Visual Studio [e.g. 2017 v15.7.1] 
- .NET Framework [e.g. 4.0]

<br> :exclamation: **Expected behavior**:<br>
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

<br> **To Reproduce**:<br>
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error.

<br>  **Screenshots**:<br>
If applicable, add screenshots to help visually demonstrate your problem.

<br> 

**Additional context**:<br>
Add any other additional context information about the issue here.

<br> 

**Note**:
- You may also post a full GitHub repository forked. Just not a zip file or half-baked snippet's etc. If GitHub is new to you consider it a great learning opportunity and chance to get involved.
- The repository should have just ONE-step max for me to get it running, and that is `Restore NuGet Packages`. If there are any other missing dependencies, or uncompiling features I will most likely move on to another `Issue`.
- When you have discovered a solution for your `Issue` and were able to resolve it successfully after testing. Then consider leaving a comment to notify that the following `Issue` has been resolved. And the process of how you resolved the `Issue`. To allow everyone else who stumbles across the same issue to workaround it until a fix for it has been released.
