### Before Submitting an Issue
First, please do a search for [open issues](https://github.com/DarkByte7/AssemblyReporter/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed. Use this [query](https://github.com/DarkByte7/VisualPlus/issues?q=is:open+is:issue+label:feature-request+sort:reactions-B1-desc) to search for the most popular feature requests.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment.

The Assembly Reporter project is may be spread across multiple reposititories, try to file the issue against the correct repository.

If your issue is a question then please ask the question on Discord. [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/433671717286707203.svg?style=flat-square)](https://discordapp.com/invite/4MHvGwp)

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, submit an issue using the guidelines below.

## Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request.

* Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.
* Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful reproducing the issue and finding a fix. 

Please include the following with each issue. 

* Describe the bug.
* Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...).
* Expected behaviour.
* Screenshots, animations, or a link to a video if applicable to explain your problem.
* Version of AssemblyReporter.
* A code snippet that demonstrates the issue or a link to a code repository we can easily pull down onto our machine to recreate the issue. 

> **Note:** Because we need to copy and paste the code snippet, including a code snippet as a media file (i.e. .gif) is not sufficient. 

Please remember to do the following:

* Search the issue repository to see if there exists a duplicate. 
* Simplify your code around the issue so we can better isolate the problem. 

Don't feel bad if we can't reproduce the issue and ask for more information!
